# Tuple in Python: Check Element Existence

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that checks if the element `'n'` and the element `8` exist within a given tuple.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Define a tuple `x` with some letters and numbers.
2. Use the `in` operator to check if the string `'n'` exists within the tuple.
3. Use the `in` operator to check if the integer `8` exists within the tuple.
4. Print the results.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
Add code here
```
# Define the tuple
x = ('a', 'n', 'g', 'e', 'l', 8, 9, 3)

# Check if 'n' exists in the tuple
print('n' in x)

# Check if 8 exists in the tuple
print(8 in x)
```

## Result
The program successfully checks for the existence of both the character 'n' and the number 8 in the given tuple and prints True for each, confirming their presence.
